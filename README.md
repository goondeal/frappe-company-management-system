## üìñ **Overview**  
This is a backend application built on the Frappe framework that provides CRUD operations for managing companies, departments, employees, and projects. It includes a workflow for employee performance reviews and implements role-based access control for secure data handling.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Installation**  
Setting up the application is straightforward. Follow these steps to install and add the app to your Frappe site:
from your frappe-bench folder:
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash  
   bench get app https://github.com/goondeal/frappe-company-management-system.git 
   ```
2. **Add it to your site**:  
   ```bash  
   bench --site <your-site-name> install-app companies
   bench restart
   ```

## **1. üõ†Ô∏è Approach and Implementation Details**  

### **Approach**  
1. **Frappe Framework**: Leveraged for its modularity and support for workflows, role-based access, and RESTful APIs.  
2. **Entities**: Designed Doctypes for `Company`, `Department`, `Employee`, `Project`, and `Performance Review`.  
3. **Workflow**: Implemented a structured employee performance review process with transitions and state-based control.  
4. **Role-Based Access Control**: Applied granular permissions for `Admin`, `Manager`, and `Employee` roles, where **Admin** has control over company, **Manager** has control over his department, and **Employee** can read his own data.
5. Manual integration testing.


### **Implementation Details**  
- **Data Models**: Created Doctypes with relationships and auto-calculated fields (e.g., `days_employed`).  
- **Workflow**: A `Performance Review` workflow manages transitions (e.g., Pending Review ‚Üí Review Scheduled).  
- **Custom Scripts**:  
  - Restricted the selection of employees in `Performance Review` based on the Admin's company or manager's department.  
  - Auto-created user accounts when adding new employees.
- **API**: Provided RESTful endpoints for all entities.  
- **Security**: Enforced role-based access control that was achieved by combining doctype permissions and `permission_query_conditions` and `has_permission` to restrict unauthorized data access.

## **3. üîê Security Measures**  
1. **Role-Based Access Control**:  
   - `Admin`: Full access to all entities related to his company.  
   - `Manager`: Restricted to managing employees, departments, and performance reviews within their department.  
   - `Employee`: View-only access to their performance review and related data.  

2. **Data Protection**:  
   - Sensitive data like passwords are hashed using Frappe's secure authentication mechanism.

## **4. üì° API Documentation**  

The API depends on frappe API approach. Visit **https://docs.frappe.io/framework/v14/user/en/api/rest** to see more rich examples. 

### **Base URL**  
http://`<site-name>`/


### **Endpoints**: 
- Full **CRUD** endpoints for all entities.
- customize the request with query parameters: `fields`, `filters`, `order_by`, `limit_start`, `limit_page_length`, and `limit`.
- For more information visit: **https://docs.frappe.io/framework/v14/user/en/api/rest**

## Future Work
Note: the task took only 2 working days of 3 due to my heavy schedule.

1. Automate the integration tests.
2. Write validations on the full detailed scenarios on the different entities.
3. After knowing the full requirements, The `Performance Review` life cycle can be improved. For examble separate the **feedback** cycle from the **Review** and automate the process, and customize the access control over it to prevent human errors.
4. After knowing the full requirements, Improve Access Control over all entities.
5. Give **admins** access to handle `Performance Review`.
